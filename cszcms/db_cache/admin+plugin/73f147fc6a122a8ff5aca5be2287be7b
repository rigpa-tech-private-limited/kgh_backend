<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 1. You will need to know the location of your nearest Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate office. Please note that Consulates accept posted visa applications only which can vary in process time depending on the office and the time of your pending departure. If you go in person to the Royal Thai Embassy applications are normally processed within three days. However this is not a guarantee, therefore it is reasonable to apply a couple of weeks before departure to allow for any unforeseen delays.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 2. Each person’s situation is different, of course, and there is no magic explanation or single document, certificate, or letter, which can guarantee visa issuance.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 3. You need to be able to articulate the reasons you will study in your chosen program.&nbsp; You should also be able to explain how studying in Thailand is related to your future professional career when you return home.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 4. It should be clear at a glance to the officer dealing with your application what written documents you are presenting and what they signify. Lengthy written explanations cannot be quickly read or evaluated. You will be required to produce a copy of the admissions acceptance letter from Assumption to yourself.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 5. Do not engage the consular officer in an argument. If you are denied a student visa, ask the officer for a list of documents he or she would suggest you bring in order to overcome the refusal, and try to get the reason for which you were denied visa in writing.</span><br> <span class="style2" style="color: #004885; font-size: 18px;"><br> <span style="color: #b31e20;"><strong>AU VISA SERVICES</strong></span></span><span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> All services are meant for full time students with proper Non-Immigrant (category Ed) Visas subject to conditions as outlined below.

The procedure to change your status is cumbersome and will take up a lot of your time. In order to change your visa status, you are required to have at least 30 valid days on your present visa. Several documents are required from both the university and you, the production of which will take time. Therefore, we strongly advise that you enter with the appropriate visa.</span></p>

This means that you are subject to the 500 Baht per day overstay fine (maximum 20,000 Baht) from the day your Passport expires. Once your passport has been extended the AU visa officer at no charge to the student can reinstate your visa with the original expiry date.If you had a multiple entry visa this will be lost. If you wish you can purchase a new multiple entry visa, from the Thai government, for 3,800 Baht.</p>

<p>The coat of arms of the Brothers of St. Gabriel, which is AU's logo, is shown and engraved on many places but the biggest and noticeable one is on the wall at a stairway in the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>It depicts four signs with meaningful content: the ship in the sea symbolizing the sea of life with difficulties that we have to struggle through; the DS Cross which represents Divinity and Science; A.M. and the white lilies to remind students to love their institution as their Alma Mater (Dear Mother) and be as pure in their thoughts, words and mind as the white lilies; and the star and the boat which symbolizes spiritual hope. The four symbols are framed by a shield under which is AU's motto "LABOR OMNIA VINCIT", which means: We can overcome all difficulties through working hard.</p>
<h4>Brothers of st.Gabriel</h4>
<p align="left">The name "the Brothers of St.Gabriel" reminds us of those Brothers who sacrificed their lives, and their mother's land, in order to help educate and develop our Thai children to grow in the right path.</p>
<p align="left">"LABOR OMNIA VINCIT" is the motto of our university. "We can overcome all difficulties through working hard," or, as the Latin proverb says : "Work conquers all things,"</p>
<h4>"Life-Boat" Symbolized By "The Ship in The Sea"</h4>
<p align="left">"The ship in the Sea" symbolizes that we have to keep on struggling and facing different difficulties in the sea of life, just like the ship or the boat that fights stormy wind, steamy sun and rainy sea in order NOT to capsize in the middle of the sea. This should always remind us that "Life is a Struggle" or "To Live is to Struggle" against the problems and difficulties and not to give up.</p>
<h4>"DS" (read "D and S") Cross In The Middle With The Cross</h4>
<p align="left">"D" or Divinity represents "Religion". We all need religion in life and mind. The Cross is the symbol of "love" and sacrifice "just as Jesus sacrificed his life for our love and he redeemed our sins as he said: "There is no other love greater than sacrificing our life for others."</p>
<p align="left">"S" or "Science" means "Knowledge," which is the root of man's ability to reason. Everyone should always aim at gaining more knowledge. the more we learn about mundane knowledge, the more we should also learn about "Dharma" or religious, ethical virtues. Moreover, D|S also comes from the French phrase, "Dieu Seul," which means "ALL WE DO IS FOR THE GRACE OF GOD ONLY." It is to remind us of St. Louis Marie de Montfort, the founding Father of the Brothers of St. Gabriel's motto. With this powerful motto, we have the will to work without yielding to difficulties, at studies as well as at work. We all uphold it up to this day.</p>
<h4>A.M. and The White Lilies</h4>
<p align="left">"A.M." is abbreviated from a Latin word, "ALMA MATER," meaning literally," Dear Mother," in Latin and indicating " MOTHER COLLEGE," which symbolizes that our institution is like our "Alma Mater", our own birth place and as a part of our own families. We should love our institution as much as we should love our own parents. Moreover, "A.M" is also abbreviated from "AVE MARIA" (in Latin), the name of Jesus' Mother. This means that we should love our own Mother with our heart and soul. And the beautiful snow-white lilies are symbols to remind us that we should be clean and sincere with all our thoughts, words and minds, wherever we are.</p>
<h4>The Star and The Man In a Boat</h4>
<p align="left">"The Star and the Boat" symbolizes "Spiritual Hope", meaning that religion is "the light of Dharma or Absolute Truth" and all the knowledge or sciences we have learned from the institution is "the Light of the Intelligence". Altogether they keep conduct and intelligence on track so we are not lost or capsized in the middle of the sea of life. "The man in the boat "reflects us, ourselves, rowing or guiding our own "boat of life."</p>
<h4>"The Shield" That Frames The "Four Symbols"</h4>
<p align="left">The "Shield" that frames the "Four Symbols" is the "COAT OF ARMS" which stands for "HONOUR," or "PRIDE and DIGNITY". It also represents the HONOUR,DIGNITY, PRIDE AND PRAISE that our institution has received from the King who reigns over the Kingdom.</p>
<h4>The Olive Branches</h4>
<p align="left">The wreath of the "Olive Branches" stands for "Victory" or "Success."(In ancient times, in Greek History, the athletic winner received a wreath of olive branches from the king) Or, this represents "a wreath of high honour" to remind us that we should do good deeds to uphold the honour and fame of our beloved institution or "ALMA MATER" forever.</p>

<p>Assumption University was initially originated from Assumption Commercial College in 1969 as an autonomous higher education institution under the name of Assumption School of Business. In 1972, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, it was officially established as Assumption Business Administration College or ABAC. In May 1975, it was accredited by the Ministry of University Affairs. In 1990, it was granted new status as "Assumption University" by the Ministry of University Affairs.</p>
<p>The University is a non-profit institution administered by the Brothers of St. Gabriel, a worldwide Catholic religious order, founded in France in 1705 by St. Louis Marie De Montfort, devoted to education and philanthropic activities. The congregation has been operating many educational institutions in Thailand since 1901.</p>
<p>The University is an international community of scholars, enlivened by Christian inspiration, engaged in the pursuit of truth and knowledge, serving the human society, especially through the creative use of interdisciplinary approaches and cybertechnology.</p>
<h4>Background of Assumption University</h4>
<h6>St.Louis Marie D' Montfort</h6>
<p align="left">A Pilgrim at The Tomb of St. Louis Marie De Montfort</p>
<p align="left">"You know that I am very indebted to this Saint and to his <i>Treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin</i>. Today because my pastoral visit has for the most part as its theme the sacrament of baptism, I would like to highlight the fact that, in the mind of St. Louis, the whole spiritual life flows directly from the sacrament of holy baptism as is shown by an important passage of the Act of Consecration to Jesus by the hands of Mary, written in his own precise wording".</p>
<p class="bodycontent" align="left">These are the words spoken by the Pope in the parish church of Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre, during his visit on 19th September 1996 to the tombs of Saint Louis Marie de Montfort and Blessed Marie Louise Trichet. Several times before this, the Pope had recalled that his reading of the <i>True Devotion</i> had been a decisive turning-point in his life, and that Montfort's spirituality had brought him to understand that genuine Marian devotion, far from distracting us from Christ, is on the contrary rooted in the mystery of Christ and can only lead towards him.</p>
<p>Three congregations trace their foundation to Saint Louis Marie de Montfort namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left">The Daughters of Wisdom, live out the loving search of Wisdom for wounded humanity through a variety of ministries, especially among those whom the world rejects and those alienated from the Church;</div>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Sedes Sapientiae : The Seat of Wisdom</h4>
<p align="justify">It is a tradition handed down for centuries that Christians venerate the Mother of Christ as "the Seat of Wisdom". (Sedes Sapientiae)</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="/images/stories/abac/sedes1.gif" alt="" align="right" border="0">According to Christian belief, Christ is the wisdom seated on the Throne. This implies, on the one hand, that the Mother of Christ is the Dwelling Place of the Supreme Wisdom of all science.</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, the university is the Alma Mater, or our Mother who is also the "Dwelling Place of Knowledge". In this context, "Assumption" which, besides its religious meaning in glorification of the Mother of Christ, has yet another meaning in Thai, namely" the Abode of Abiding Knowledge" Rightly, "Assumption University" is the Seat of Wisdom.</p>
<h4>Ashoka Tree</h4>
<p align="justify"><br>The Assumption University has adopted the Ashoka Tree as its symbol. The Ashoka Tree has as its scientific name "<i>Polyalthea longifolia</i> Benth &amp; Hook. f. var. <i>pandurata</i>" of a Anonanceae Family, a native plant of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The Rationale behind the choice of the Ashoka Tree</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="/images/stories/abac/ashokatree.gif" alt="" align="right" border="0">The reasons why the University has taken it as its symbol are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is an ever-green tree. This fact signifies freshness, coolness, and constancy, unwavering with the turning of seasons and the changes of time. Thus, it means that the University is determined to fulfill its mission, giving emphasis to academic excellence together with quality and virtues.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree has a most beautiful form, majestically tall, like a stupa.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is a tree with a beneficial name, because it derives from an Indian word "Ashok", after the name of King Ashok, the Great, the most well known king during Buddha's time, full of wisdom both in the secular and religious realms.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Lastly, it is the tree first brought from India into Thailand in 1957 by the St.Gabriel Foundation of Thailand, patrons of this university (by Bro. John Mary). This first tree was planted in the compound of St. Gabriel's College, and the Forestry Department of Thailand named it "St. Gabriel Ashoka" on 15 th December 1969. Botanic Features of the Ashoka Tree</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is an ever green tree, of narrow-top can form and majestically tall. The bark is grey; its color becomes darker near the extreme top of the trunk, covered with leaves from the bottom to the top, so thick that the trunk's characteristics can hardly be clearly visible. Its leaves are lanceolate, about 0.5-0.7 inches wide, and 4-9 inches long. The widest part of the leaf is near the base; its rim is smooth, but twisted into a tide-like form. Its flower is white greenish shade, without odor, about 1.5-1.75 inches wide. Its fruit is ellipsoid, about 0.5 inches wide and 0.75 inches long, with smooth shiny skin; its color turns yellow, red, then finally black, when it is ripe. Normally, the ripening of the fruit OCCURS between July and August every year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #555;"><br> At the Hua Mak Campus in the city, although the University will not be able to offer graduate students accommodation in campus, but there are a wide range of neighboring townhouses, rooms and condominiums to choose from. Those are at the immediate area of Au and the range of rents starting from 3,000 baht up to 12,000 baht per month. The rents may or may not include electricity and water. Phones usually cost extra. The electricity is 220 volts and 50 hertz. If you are not offered accommodation by your college, or it is unable to provide the type of housing you need, you should contact the Au International Center.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #555;">At the Suvarnabhumi Campus, there are formal residence halls that have been beautifully designed and furnished with color TV, refrigerator, telephone, private bath and fiber-optic Internet connections. The rooms come in a variety of arrangements such as singles, doubles, triples and quads to accommodate students who wish to live alone or to share with friends. In addition, there are laundry and food services, a well-equipped physical fitness center as well as basketball, volleyball and tennis courts located adjacent to the halls. For the less athletic, there is also a table tennis recreation and board game room. A comprehensive sports complex is under construction, which will have a 50-meter Olympic sized swimming pool, an indoor stadium, gymnasium and other fitness space.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 1. You will need to know the location of your nearest Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate office. Please note that Consulates accept posted visa applications only which can vary in process time depending on the office and the time of your pending departure. If you go in person to the Royal Thai Embassy applications are normally processed within three days. However this is not a guarantee, therefore it is reasonable to apply a couple of weeks before departure to allow for any unforeseen delays.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 2. Each person’s situation is different, of course, and there is no magic explanation or single document, certificate, or letter, which can guarantee visa issuance.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 3. You need to be able to articulate the reasons you will study in your chosen program.&nbsp; You should also be able to explain how studying in Thailand is related to your future professional career when you return home.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 4. It should be clear at a glance to the officer dealing with your application what written documents you are presenting and what they signify. Lengthy written explanations cannot be quickly read or evaluated. You will be required to produce a copy of the admissions acceptance letter from Assumption to yourself.</span><br> <span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> 5. Do not engage the consular officer in an argument. If you are denied a student visa, ask the officer for a list of documents he or she would suggest you bring in order to overcome the refusal, and try to get the reason for which you were denied visa in writing.</span><br> <span class="style2" style="color: #004885; font-size: 18px;"><br> <span style="color: #b31e20;"><strong>AU VISA SERVICES</strong></span></span><span style="color: #555; font-size: 12px;"><br> All services are meant for full time students with proper Non-Immigrant (category Ed) Visas subject to conditions as outlined below.

The procedure to change your status is cumbersome and will take up a lot of your time. In order to change your visa status, you are required to have at least 30 valid days on your present visa. Several documents are required from both the university and you, the production of which will take time. Therefore, we strongly advise that you enter with the appropriate visa.</span></p>

<p>The coat of arms of the Brothers of St. Gabriel, which is AU's logo, is shown and engraved on many places but the biggest and noticeable one is on the wall at a stairway in the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>It depicts four signs with meaningful content: the ship in the sea symbolizing the sea of life with difficulties that we have to struggle through; the DS Cross which represents Divinity and Science; A.M. and the white lilies to remind students to love their institution as their Alma Mater (Dear Mother) and be as pure in their thoughts, words and mind as the white lilies; and the star and the boat which symbolizes spiritual hope. The four symbols are framed by a shield under which is AU's motto "LABOR OMNIA VINCIT", which means: We can overcome all difficulties through working hard.</p>
<h4>Brothers of st.Gabriel</h4>
<p align="left">The name "the Brothers of St.Gabriel" reminds us of those Brothers who sacrificed their lives, and their mother's land, in order to help educate and develop our Thai children to grow in the right path.</p>
<p align="left">"LABOR OMNIA VINCIT" is the motto of our university. "We can overcome all difficulties through working hard," or, as the Latin proverb says : "Work conquers all things,"</p>
<h4>"Life-Boat" Symbolized By "The Ship in The Sea"</h4>
<p align="left">"The ship in the Sea" symbolizes that we have to keep on struggling and facing different difficulties in the sea of life, just like the ship or the boat that fights stormy wind, steamy sun and rainy sea in order NOT to capsize in the middle of the sea. This should always remind us that "Life is a Struggle" or "To Live is to Struggle" against the problems and difficulties and not to give up.</p>
<h4>"DS" (read "D and S") Cross In The Middle With The Cross</h4>
<p align="left">"D" or Divinity represents "Religion". We all need religion in life and mind. The Cross is the symbol of "love" and sacrifice "just as Jesus sacrificed his life for our love and he redeemed our sins as he said: "There is no other love greater than sacrificing our life for others."</p>
<p align="left">"S" or "Science" means "Knowledge," which is the root of man's ability to reason. Everyone should always aim at gaining more knowledge. the more we learn about mundane knowledge, the more we should also learn about "Dharma" or religious, ethical virtues. Moreover, D|S also comes from the French phrase, "Dieu Seul," which means "ALL WE DO IS FOR THE GRACE OF GOD ONLY." It is to remind us of St. Louis Marie de Montfort, the founding Father of the Brothers of St. Gabriel's motto. With this powerful motto, we have the will to work without yielding to difficulties, at studies as well as at work. We all uphold it up to this day.</p>
<h4>A.M. and The White Lilies</h4>
<p align="left">"A.M." is abbreviated from a Latin word, "ALMA MATER," meaning literally," Dear Mother," in Latin and indicating " MOTHER COLLEGE," which symbolizes that our institution is like our "Alma Mater", our own birth place and as a part of our own families. We should love our institution as much as we should love our own parents. Moreover, "A.M" is also abbreviated from "AVE MARIA" (in Latin), the name of Jesus' Mother. This means that we should love our own Mother with our heart and soul. And the beautiful snow-white lilies are symbols to remind us that we should be clean and sincere with all our thoughts, words and minds, wherever we are.</p>
<h4>The Star and The Man In a Boat</h4>
<p align="left">"The Star and the Boat" symbolizes "Spiritual Hope", meaning that religion is "the light of Dharma or Absolute Truth" and all the knowledge or sciences we have learned from the institution is "the Light of the Intelligence". Altogether they keep conduct and intelligence on track so we are not lost or capsized in the middle of the sea of life. "The man in the boat "reflects us, ourselves, rowing or guiding our own "boat of life."</p>
<h4>"The Shield" That Frames The "Four Symbols"</h4>
<p align="left">The "Shield" that frames the "Four Symbols" is the "COAT OF ARMS" which stands for "HONOUR," or "PRIDE and DIGNITY". It also represents the HONOUR,DIGNITY, PRIDE AND PRAISE that our institution has received from the King who reigns over the Kingdom.</p>
<h4>The Olive Branches</h4>
<p align="left">The wreath of the "Olive Branches" stands for "Victory" or "Success."(In ancient times, in Greek History, the athletic winner received a wreath of olive branches from the king) Or, this represents "a wreath of high honour" to remind us that we should do good deeds to uphold the honour and fame of our beloved institution or "ALMA MATER" forever.</p>

<p>Assumption University was initially originated from Assumption Commercial College in 1969 as an autonomous higher education institution under the name of Assumption School of Business. In 1972, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, it was officially established as Assumption Business Administration College or ABAC. In May 1975, it was accredited by the Ministry of University Affairs. In 1990, it was granted new status as "Assumption University" by the Ministry of University Affairs.</p>
<p>The University is a non-profit institution administered by the Brothers of St. Gabriel, a worldwide Catholic religious order, founded in France in 1705 by St. Louis Marie De Montfort, devoted to education and philanthropic activities. The congregation has been operating many educational institutions in Thailand since 1901.</p>
<p>The University is an international community of scholars, enlivened by Christian inspiration, engaged in the pursuit of truth and knowledge, serving the human society, especially through the creative use of interdisciplinary approaches and cybertechnology.</p>
<h4>Background of Assumption University</h4>
<h6>St.Louis Marie D' Montfort</h6>
<p align="left">A Pilgrim at The Tomb of St. Louis Marie De Montfort</p>
<p align="left">"You know that I am very indebted to this Saint and to his <i>Treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin</i>. Today because my pastoral visit has for the most part as its theme the sacrament of baptism, I would like to highlight the fact that, in the mind of St. Louis, the whole spiritual life flows directly from the sacrament of holy baptism as is shown by an important passage of the Act of Consecration to Jesus by the hands of Mary, written in his own precise wording".</p>
<p class="bodycontent" align="left">These are the words spoken by the Pope in the parish church of Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre, during his visit on 19th September 1996 to the tombs of Saint Louis Marie de Montfort and Blessed Marie Louise Trichet. Several times before this, the Pope had recalled that his reading of the <i>True Devotion</i> had been a decisive turning-point in his life, and that Montfort's spirituality had brought him to understand that genuine Marian devotion, far from distracting us from Christ, is on the contrary rooted in the mystery of Christ and can only lead towards him.</p>
<p>Three congregations trace their foundation to Saint Louis Marie de Montfort namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left">The Daughters of Wisdom, live out the loving search of Wisdom for wounded humanity through a variety of ministries, especially among those whom the world rejects and those alienated from the Church;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left">The Company of Mary, popularly know today as the Montfort Missionaries, devoting themselves to priestly ministry and preaching</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left"><span class="bodycontent">The Brothers of the Christian Instruction of St. Gabriel, popularly known today as Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel, formerly known as the Community of the Holy Spirit, dedicating themselves to Christian education and working among the underprivileged</span>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sedes Sapientiae : The Seat of Wisdom</h4>
<p align="justify">It is a tradition handed down for centuries that Christians venerate the Mother of Christ as "the Seat of Wisdom". (Sedes Sapientiae)</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="/images/stories/abac/sedes1.gif" alt="" align="right" border="0">According to Christian belief, Christ is the wisdom seated on the Throne. This implies, on the one hand, that the Mother of Christ is the Dwelling Place of the Supreme Wisdom of all science.</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, the university is the Alma Mater, or our Mother who is also the "Dwelling Place of Knowledge". In this context, "Assumption" which, besides its religious meaning in glorification of the Mother of Christ, has yet another meaning in Thai, namely" the Abode of Abiding Knowledge" Rightly, "Assumption University" is the Seat of Wisdom.</p>
<h4>Ashoka Tree</h4>
<p align="justify"><br>The Assumption University has adopted the Ashoka Tree as its symbol. The Ashoka Tree has as its scientific name "<i>Polyalthea longifolia</i> Benth &amp; Hook. f. var. <i>pandurata</i>" of a Anonanceae Family, a native plant of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The Rationale behind the choice of the Ashoka Tree</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="/images/stories/abac/ashokatree.gif" alt="" align="right" border="0">The reasons why the University has taken it as its symbol are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is an ever-green tree. This fact signifies freshness, coolness, and constancy, unwavering with the turning of seasons and the changes of time. Thus, it means that the University is determined to fulfill its mission, giving emphasis to academic excellence together with quality and virtues.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree has a most beautiful form, majestically tall, like a stupa.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is a tree with a beneficial name, because it derives from an Indian word "Ashok", after the name of King Ashok, the Great, the most well known king during Buddha's time, full of wisdom both in the secular and religious realms.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Lastly, it is the tree first brought from India into Thailand in 1957 by the St.Gabriel Foundation of Thailand, patrons of this university (by Bro. John Mary). This first tree was planted in the compound of St. Gabriel's College, and the Forestry Department of Thailand named it "St. Gabriel Ashoka" on 15 th December 1969. Botanic Features of the Ashoka Tree</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">The Ashoka Tree is an ever green tree, of narrow-top can form and majestically tall. The bark is grey; its color becomes darker near the extreme top of the trunk, covered with leaves from the bottom to the top, so thick that the trunk's characteristics can hardly be clearly visible. Its leaves are lanceolate, about 0.5-0.7 inches wide, and 4-9 inches long. The widest part of the leaf is near the base; its rim is smooth, but twisted into a tide-like form. Its flower is white greenish shade, without odor, about 1.5-1.75 inches wide. Its fruit is ellipsoid, about 0.5 inches wide and 0.75 inches long, with smooth shiny skin; its color turns yellow, red, then finally black, when it is ripe. Normally, the ripening of the fruit OCCURS between July and August every year.</p>
